# Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Course!

This documentation serves as your comprehensive guide to understanding and building embodied AI systems. Throughout these modules, you will embark on a journey from foundational concepts to advanced applications, covering critical areas such as:

*   **Physical AI Foundations:** Explore the core principles that enable intelligence to interact with the real world, including perception, reasoning, and action in physical systems.
*   **ROS 2 Fundamentals and Gazebo Simulation:** Learn the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) for modular robot software development and gain hands-on experience with Gazebo for realistic robot simulation.
*   **Advanced Robotics Simulation:** Delve into sophisticated simulation environments like Unity, NVIDIA Isaac Sim, and Isaac ROS, essential tools for rapid prototyping and testing of complex robotic behaviors.
*   **Humanoid Robotics, VLA, and Conversational AI:** Master the intricacies of humanoid kinematics and control, understand Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems that bridge perception with intelligent action, and explore the cutting-edge of conversational robotics, including the transformative role of Large Language Models (LLMs).

By the end of this course, you will have a solid theoretical understanding and practical skills to design, simulate, and potentially implement sophisticated Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics systems. Whether you're aiming for simulation-first development or preparing for hardware integration, this documentation provides the structured path to empower you as a builder of embodied intelligence.
