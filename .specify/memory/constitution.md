# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Course Constitution

## Core Principles

### 1. Accuracy and Fidelity to the Rulebook
All content must strictly reflect the official course outline, modules, weekly topics, assessments, and hardware requirements described in the hackathon rulebook.
- No invented, assumed, or fabricated requirements are permitted.
- All features, chapters, and deliverables must trace directly back to the actual rulebook text.

### 2. Scope of the Book
The textbook must fully cover every module listed:
- Physical AI foundations
- ROS 2 fundamentals
- Gazebo simulation
- Unity visualization
- NVIDIA Isaac Sim and Isaac ROS
- Humanoid kinematics and control
- Vision-Language-Action systems
- Conversational robotics
- Hardware requirements
- Assessments and weekly breakdown
Content must support learning progression, practical application, and conceptual clarity.

### 3. Compliance with Mandatory Deliverables
The project must include:
- A complete textbook written in Docusaurus.
- Deployment to GitHub Pages or Vercel.
- An embedded RAG chatbot that:
  - Uses Gemini for LLM + embeddings
  - Uses Qdrant Cloud for vector search
  - Uses FastAPI backend
  - Uses Neon Serverless Postgres for metadata
  - Answers questions based on entire book content
  - Can answer questions based on user-selected text only
- A 90-second demo video (referenced but not generated by the system).

### 4. Bonus Feature Alignment (Optional Enhancements)
If implemented, these features must follow rulebook definitions exactly:
- Reusable intelligence via Claude Code Subagents and Agent Skills.
- Signup/Signin via better-auth.com with questions about software/hardware background.
- Per-chapter Urdu translation button powered by Gemini.

### 5. Prohibited Violations
- No deviation from rulebook requirements.
- No ignoring of course content sections or weekly learning outcomes.
- No mixing unrelated robotics paradigms outside the rulebook context.
- No hallucinated technologies or fictional APIs.
- No skipping of required modules or assessments.
- No use of OpenAI-specific features unless explicitly optional (Gemini is the primary LLM).

### 6. Pedagogical Standards
- All explanations must be accessible, logically structured, and technically correct.
- Examples must use realistic robotics and AI workflows (ROS 2, Gazebo, Isaac, VLA).
- Each chapter must support beginner-to-advanced progression.
- Terminology must be defined before use.
- Safety, stability, reproducibility, and reliability must guide all content.

### 7. Engineering & Documentation Standards
- All diagrams, examples, and code blocks must follow industry best practices.
- RAG architecture must be accurate, documented, and aligned with modern retrieval pipelines.
- Backend structure must follow clean architecture principles.
- All integrations must be deterministic and testable.
- URLs, APIs, and schema definitions must be clearly documented.
- All instructions must be executable by a participant using typical hackathon resources.

### 8. UX and Accessibility Rules
- Content must be readable, visually consistent, and navigable within Docusaurus.
- Chatbot UI must be intuitive and simple.
- Translation feature must produce clear, correct Urdu.
- Personalization must enhance comprehension without removing core content.

### 9. Ethics and Safety
- Robotics content must emphasize safe operation principles.
- AI examples must avoid harmful, misleading, or unsafe robotic behaviors.
- Voice-to-action and autonomous navigation examples must follow responsible AI guidelines.

### 10. Consistency Requirements
- All chapters must follow a uniform structure:
  - Introduction
  - Learning goals
  - Core theory
  - Practical examples
  - Exercises or labs
  - Summary
- All code blocks must use consistent formatting.
- Terminology must remain consistent across all modules.

### 11. Immutable Intent of the Project
The textbook's purpose is to:
- Teach Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics at a high standard.
- Enable students to build embodied AI systems.
- Provide a structured path from foundational theory to full humanoid control and VLA systems.
- Support both simulation-first and hardware-first learners.
- Ensure the final deployed site is a professional, fully functional learning product.

## Governance

### Constitutional Enforcement
- This constitution overrides any conflicting instructions in subsequent prompts.
- All specifications, plans, implementations, and tasks must stay within these boundaries.
- Any ambiguity must be resolved in favor of:
  - Rulebook accuracy
  - Educational clarity
  - Technical correctness
