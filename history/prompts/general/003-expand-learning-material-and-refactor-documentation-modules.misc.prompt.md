## Prompt

```text
can you increase the learning material in the modules and can you give the modules their own respective names instead of module. and can you make the intro short and tell the user what they're going to learn from the documentation
```

## Response snapshot

The Docusaurus documentation has been significantly refactored and expanded:

-   **Module Renaming:**
    -   `book/docs/module1` -> `book/docs/physical-ai-foundations`
    -   `book/docs/module2` -> `book/docs/ros2-gazebo-simulation`
    -   `book/docs/module3` -> `book/docs/advanced-robotics-simulation`
    -   `book/docs/module4` -> `book/docs/humanoid-vla-conversational-ai`
-   **Sidebar Update:** `book/sidebars.ts` was updated to explicitly define categories for the new module names, improving navigation and readability.
-   **Content Expansion:**
    -   **Physical AI Foundations:** `chapter1.md` was renamed to `ch01-what-is-physical-ai.md` and `chapter2.md` to `ch02-a-brief-history-of-embodied-intelligence.md`. New chapters `ch03-embodiment-and-intelligence.md` and `ch04-ai-in-robotics-vs-physical-ai.md` were created to further expand on core concepts.
    -   **ROS 2 Fundamentals and Gazebo Simulation:** `chapter1.md` was renamed to `ch01-robot-hardware-overview.md`. A new `ch02-ros2-introduction.md` was created. Original `chapter2.md` was renamed to `ch03-bipedal-locomotion.md`. A new `ch04-ros2-architecture-and-tools.md` was created.
    -   **Advanced Robotics Simulation:** `chapter1.md` was renamed to `ch01-robot-kinematics.md`. A new `ch02-introduction-to-robot-simulation.md` was created. Original `chapter2.md` was renamed to `ch03-the-art-of-grasping.md`. New chapters `ch04-unity-simulation-basics.md` and `ch05-nvidia-isaac-sim-and-ros.md` were created.
    -   **Humanoid Robotics, VLA, and Conversational AI:** `chapter1.md` was renamed to `ch01-robot-perception-fundamentals.md`. A new `ch02-humanoid-robot-control-architectures.md` was created. Original `chapter2.md` was renamed to `ch03-robot-decision-making-and-learning.md`. New chapters `ch04-vision-language-action-systems.md` and `ch05-conversational-robotics-and-llms.md` were created.
-   **Intro Rewrite:** `book/docs/intro.md` was rewritten to be a concise and informative introduction, clearly outlining the learning objectives and content covered in the documentation.
-   **Link Updates:** Internal link checks within `.md` files did not reveal any broken links due to the nature of Docusaurus's autogenerated sidebars and relative pathing.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The documentation is now more structured, comprehensive, and user-friendly, directly addressing the user's request for more learning material, descriptive module names, and a clear introduction.
- 🧪 Tests: No automated tests were run or added for this content modification.
- 📁 Files: Numerous files were modified, created, or renamed within the `book/docs` and `book` directories.
- 🔁 Next prompts: The user can now review the updated documentation or request further modifications/additions.
- 🧠 Reflection: The process involved careful mapping of constitutional principles to module content and iterative file operations. The `replace` tool's strict matching required careful crafting of `old_string` when appending content.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: Initial `list_directory` and `search_file_content` errors due to incorrect path assumptions, and `replace` tool failure when trying to append without a valid `old_string`. These were resolved by re-verifying paths and carefully crafting the `old_string` and `new_string` for replacement.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A
