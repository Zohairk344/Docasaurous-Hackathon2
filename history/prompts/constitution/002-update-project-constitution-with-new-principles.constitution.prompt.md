## Prompt

```text
/sp.constitution                                                          Establish the unbreakable principles, constraints, and foundational rules guiding the creation of a complete, accurate, pedagogically sound, and technically correct documentation website and textbook for the “Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics” course, including a Gemini-powered RAG chatbot, deployable Docusaurus site, and optional Urdu translation and personalization features.

Non-Negotiable Project Principles:

1. Accuracy and Fidelity to the Rulebook
- All content must strictly reflect the official course outline, modules, weekly topics, assessments, and hardware requirements described in the hackathon rulebook.
- No invented, assumed, or fabricated requirements are permitted.
- All features, chapters, and deliverables must trace directly back to the actual rulebook text.

2. Scope of the Book
- The textbook must fully cover every module listed:
  • Physical AI foundations  
  • ROS 2 fundamentals  
  • Gazebo simulation  
  • Unity visualization  
  • NVIDIA Isaac Sim and Isaac ROS  
  • Humanoid kinematics and control  
  • Vision-Language-Action systems  
  • Conversational robotics  
  • Hardware requirements  
  • Assessments and weekly breakdown  
- Content must support learning progression, practical application, and conceptual clarity.

3. Compliance with Mandatory Deliverables
The project must include:
- A complete textbook written in Docusaurus.
- Deployment to GitHub Pages or Vercel.
- An embedded RAG chatbot that:
  • Uses Gemini for LLM + embeddings  
  • Uses Qdrant Cloud for vector search  
  • Uses FastAPI backend  
  • Uses Neon Serverless Postgres for metadata  
  • Answers questions based on entire book content  
  • Can answer questions based on user-selected text only  
- A 90-second demo video (referenced but not generated by the system).

4. Bonus Feature Alignment (Optional Enhancements)
If implemented, these features must follow rulebook definitions exactly:
- Reusable intelligence via Claude Code Subagents and Agent Skills.
- Signup/Signin via better-auth.com with questions about software/hardware background.
- Per-chapter personalization button based on user background.
- Per-chapter Urdu translation button powered by Gemini.

5. Prohibited Violations
- No deviation from rulebook requirements.
- No ignoring of course content sections or weekly learning outcomes.
- No mixing unrelated robotics paradigms outside the rulebook context.
- No hallucinated technologies or fictional APIs.
- No skipping of required modules or assessments.
- No use of OpenAI-specific features unless explicitly optional (Gemini is the primary LLM).

6. Pedagogical Standards
- All explanations must be accessible, logically structured, and technically correct.
- Examples must use realistic robotics and AI workflows (ROS 2, Gazebo, Isaac, VLA).
- Each chapter must support beginner-to-advanced progression.
- Terminology must be defined before use.
- Safety, stability, reproducibility, and reliability must guide all content.

7. Engineering & Documentation Standards
- All diagrams, examples, and code blocks must follow industry best practices.
- RAG architecture must be accurate, documented, and aligned with modern retrieval pipelines.
- Backend structure must follow clean architecture principles.
- All integrations must be deterministic and testable.
- URLs, APIs, and schema definitions must be clearly documented.
- All instructions must be executable by a participant using typical hackathon resources.

8. UX and Accessibility Rules
- Content must be readable, visually consistent, and navigable within Docusaurus.
- Chatbot UI must be intuitive and simple.
- Translation feature must produce clear, correct Urdu.
- Personalization must enhance comprehension without removing core content.

9. Ethics and Safety
- Robotics content must emphasize safe operation principles.
- AI examples must avoid harmful, misleading, or unsafe robotic behaviors.
- Voice-to-action and autonomous navigation examples must follow responsible AI guidelines.

10. Consistency Requirements
- All chapters must follow a uniform structure:
  • Introduction  
  • Learning goals  
  • Core theory  
  • Practical examples  
  • Exercises or labs  
  • Summary  
- All code blocks must use consistent formatting.
- Terminology must remain consistent across all modules.

11. Immutable Intent of the Project
The textbook's purpose is to:
- Teach Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics at a high standard.
- Enable students to build embodied AI systems.
- Provide a structured path from foundational theory to full humanoid control and VLA systems.
- Support both simulation-first and hardware-first learners.
- Ensure the final deployed site is a professional, fully functional learning product.

Constitutional Enforcement:
- This constitution overrides any conflicting instructions in subsequent prompts.
- All specifications, plans, implementations, and tasks must stay within these boundaries.
- Any ambiguity must be resolved in favor of:
  • Rulebook accuracy  
  • Educational clarity  
  • Technical correctness
```

## Response snapshot

The project constitution was successfully updated in `.specify/memory/constitution.md` with new principles, reflecting the user's input. The previous content was completely replaced. Consistency checks were performed on `plan-template.md`, `spec-template.md`, `tasks-template.md`, `.gemini/commands/sp.constitution.toml`, and `book/README.md`, with no changes required for these files as their structure already aligned or did not directly depend on the specific content of the constitution principles. The `GEMINI.md` file (at the root of the overall project) could not be updated due to scope restrictions.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The project's foundational principles and rules are now explicitly defined and documented, providing a clear guide for all future development.
- 🧪 Tests: No automated tests were run or added for this operation.
- 📁 Files: One file was modified: `.specify/memory/constitution.md`.
- 🔁 Next prompts: The user is expected to acknowledge the update and proceed with further development based on the new constitution.
- 🧠 Reflection: The process of updating the constitution was successful, but the limitation regarding updating files outside the direct working directory (like the root `GEMINI.md`) should be noted for future interactions. This could lead to a discrepancy in documentation if not handled manually by the user.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: The `create-phr.sh` script failed due to platform incompatibility (bash script on Windows). This was mitigated by manually constructing the PHR. The `replace` tool also failed initially due to strict matching, requiring a re-read of the file. The `GEMINI.md` update was cancelled due to scope restrictions.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A
